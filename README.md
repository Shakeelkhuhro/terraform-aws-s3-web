# AWS S3 Static Website Portfolio

This project provisions an AWS S3 bucket to host a static portfolio website using Terraform. It includes infrastructure-as-code for S3 bucket creation, public access configuration, website hosting, and deployment of static assets (HTML, CSS, and image files).

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All AWS resources are managed via Terraform.
- **Static Website Hosting**: S3 bucket configured for static website hosting with custom index and error pages.
- **Public Access**: Proper ACLs and ownership controls for public-read access.
- **Easy Deployment**: Just run `terraform apply` to deploy or update your site.
